This project is a novel music recommendation system that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze and understand song lyrics. Unlike conventional systems that rely on metadata like artist or genre, this model focuses on the lyrical content itself. It employs a content-based filtering approach, using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to transform lyrics into a numerical format, which allows for the calculation of similarity between songs. The system, accessible via a Streamlit user interface, provides personalized recommendations and enhances the user experience by fetching album art from the Spotify API. This method offers a unique way to discover music based on shared lyrical themes.
